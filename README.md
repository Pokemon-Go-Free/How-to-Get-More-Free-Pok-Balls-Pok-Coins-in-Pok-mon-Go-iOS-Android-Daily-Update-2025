### 1. Free Pok√© Balls from Pok√©Stops

One of the easiest and most reliable ways to gather **Pok√© Balls** is by visiting **Pok√©Stops**. These are locations in the real world that are marked on your Pok√©mon Go map, and they allow you to spin the Pok√©Stop to collect items like Pok√© Balls, Potions, and other useful items.

Here‚Äôs how to maximize your Pok√© Ball collection through Pok√©Stops:

- **Daily Spins**: Every day, you can spin a Pok√©Stop once to receive a set of random items, including Pok√© Balls. Don‚Äôt forget to make this a part of your daily routine.
- **Pok√©Stop Streak**: For every consecutive day you spin a Pok√©Stop, you increase your chances of receiving more Pok√© Balls. The more days you spin in a row, the better your rewards!
- **Keep Visiting Pok√©Stops**: Try to visit as many different Pok√©Stops as possible to maximize your item collection.

Make sure you‚Äôre using your time wisely by setting out to visit several Pok√©Stops in a single session. If you‚Äôre in a city or park with many Pok√©Stops close to each other, this method is particularly effective.

To collect Pok√© Balls through Gifts:

- **Open Gifts Regularly**: Make sure to open any gifts sent by friends, as they can include a variety of items, including Pok√© Balls.
